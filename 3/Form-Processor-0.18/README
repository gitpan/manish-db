Form-Processor
==============

This is a module to aide in moving data between and internal
state and an external state and provide validation along the way.
Typically that means between a database and an HTML form.

The module is modeled after Rose::HTML::Objects in a lot of ways.
Although, Rose::HTML::Objects is more centered on the HTML generation
and this module is more centered on the database part.
